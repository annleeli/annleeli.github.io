> Annlee is so awesome!
  <cite>&mdash; A Relavent Person</cite>
  
  I am currently in my first year at the University of Waterloo, studying **Computer Science** with co-op. I have a passion for new technologies, the internet and sometimes art. 
  
  I have dabbled in **web development**, **mobile development**, and **game development**. 
  
  Born in Norway, but raised in Toronto, I consider myself a would-be well-travelled girl. If I had the funds, I would go out to explore the world, but alas, one does not have many dollars before one's first job. 
  
  Please check out my resume and decide to hire me regardless of my inexperience.
