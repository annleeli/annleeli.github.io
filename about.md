> Annlee is so awesome!
  <cite>&mdash; A Relavent Person</cite>
  
  I am currently in my first year at the University of Waterloo, studying **Computer Science** with co-op. I have a passion for new technologies, the internet and sometimes art. 
  
  I have dabbled in **web development**, **mobile development**, and **game development**. I am very interesting in UI design and also UX design. 
  
  Born in Norway, but raised in Toronto, I consider myself a would-be well-travelled girl. If I had the funds, I would go out to explore the world, but alas, one does not have many dollars before one's first job. 
  
  I am willing to learn new things and would love the opportunity to work somewhere that does amazing things!
