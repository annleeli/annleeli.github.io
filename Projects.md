Some of my previous and ongoing projects. 
## Eat the Sweets
![Eat the Sweets](http://i.imgur.com/r6AaxjL.png)  
A fast-pased, vertical-scrolling platformer game created in Turing. Goal is to collect as many sweets as you can without falling off before reaching the goal. This was my first experience in creating a game. Some graphics are created by me, while others are borrowed from MapleStory.

Source code coming soon to Github...

## Quidditch Flight Simulator

## CountingStars
In-progress Android application for keeping track of things in life. It is a counter app that can be used for keeping track of times something happens, (e.g. yellow cars, science experiments or more).
