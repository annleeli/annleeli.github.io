## Eat the Sweets | <small>[Github source](https://github.com/polkabear/EatTheSweets)</small>
A fast-pased, vertical-scrolling platformer game created in Turing. Goal is to collect as many sweets as you can without falling off before reaching the goal. This was my first experience in creating a game. Some graphics are created by me, while others are borrowed from MapleStory.
