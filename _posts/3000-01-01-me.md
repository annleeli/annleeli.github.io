  I am currently in my second year at the University of Waterloo, studying **Computer Science** with co-op. I have a passion for new technologies, the internet and art. 
  
  I have experience in **web development**, **mobile development**, and **game development**. I also am very interested in UI/UX design. 
  
  I love unconventional sports like parkour, juggling or rock climbing that tests your athletic abilities above and beyond.
