title: Hi, I'm Annlee
---
  I am currently in my third year at the University of Waterloo, studying **Computer Science** with co-op. I have a passion for new technologies, the internet and art. 
  
  This year, from September to December 2017, I will be studying at the Universtiy of Hong Kong as an exchange student. I hope to explore both Hong Kong and the rest of Asia. 
  
  I have experience in **web development** and **application development**. I also am very interested in UI/UX design. 
  
  I love unconventional sports like rock climbing that tests your athletic abilities above and beyond.
