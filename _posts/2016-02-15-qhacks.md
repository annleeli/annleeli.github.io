Recently I went to qHacks 2016 which is Queen's first hackathon! The ride from Waterloo to Queen's was long, but worth it. The hack that my team created was a website that incorporated machine learning results and displayed them in an easy-to-understand format. It was my first time incorporating external APIs that needed to fetch results from the web, which was an interesting learning curve. It was also my first time really creating a website from scratch. 

Our AngularJS website analyzes (current, as of Mar 2016) American Presidential Candidates' speeches with [indico.io](https://indico.io/). It does some calculations and displays the data using [chart.js](http://www.chartjs.org/).
