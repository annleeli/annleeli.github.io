The past few weeks have been a whirlwind of excitement. I finally got a job after a few nervous weeks of the first round of Jobmine. I can't wait to start my job and hopefully I learn a lot!

It's pretty far from where I live so I should probably look into how I can ckeep preoccupised on the hour long bus ride. Or maybe location based alarm clocks might be a thing I can use...
