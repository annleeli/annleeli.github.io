Welcome to my new Jekyll site (super awesome and cool way of making a site). 

## Markdown

All posts can be written in [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/). Here's a [cheatsheet](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet) for Markdown and one can also use [prose.io](prose.io) as a convenient editor. 

## Looking forward

I will be trying more things with Jekyll and Github in the coming weeks (hopefully) and getting a little more work done onto my pet Android project ([Counting Stars](/portfolio/#stars)). 

I will also be looking into how to customize the website without breaking the core functionality and see how to install other themes without post migration frustrations.
