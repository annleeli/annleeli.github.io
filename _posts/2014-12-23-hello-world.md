Getting this site up was a learning experience that I have still not completely figured out. I really want to understand Jekyll (because I think it is really cool and useful) but my local installation isn't working out. And so I may have given up and just downloaded a template instead. 

## It uses Markdown

All posts can be written in [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/). Here's a [cheatsheet](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet) for me to use if I need reminders. Or I can use [prose.io](prose.io) as an editor. 

## Looking forward

I will be trying more things with Jekyll and Github in the coming weeks (hopefully) and getting a little more work done onto my pet Android project (which also has a huge learning curve for me).

I will also be looking into how to customize the website without breaking the core functionality and see how to install other themes without post migration frustrations.
